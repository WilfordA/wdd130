        <p>Hello, my name is Jairo Alvarado, I am from Piura, Peru, I currently live in Lima. I am 24 years old, I am currently working for a company called Teleperformance, my job is to provide customer service through calls, my work hours are from 6am to 3pm, I have been with the company for almost a year and a half. By the way, the language I speak at work is English. I like it a lot because I'm learning the language a little more. I really know that I still need to improve a lot, but honestly my work has helped me a lot to improve my English skills.</p>
        <p>My family is made up of 6 people plus my pet that we consider part of the family, it is a dog his name is Rex, he has been with us for 8 years. I really like to exercise, listen to music and spend time with my family.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, I am very excited to start studying, I hope to be able to learn as much as possible and to be able to develop new skills along the way.</p>
        <p>I served in a mission, I had to go to Monterrey in Mexico, the mission was a very important time in my life and I always carry in my heart and mind the memories I had there. I am also about to get married in November. I am excited for this new stage that I will have in my life.</p>
